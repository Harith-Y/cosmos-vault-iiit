     * **Concern** | Internal fragmentation occurs when page size exceeds actual
       usage, leading to wasted memory.
     * **Fact** | If there are 64 pages, 6 bits are needed to refer to the page; for
       a page size of 4KB, 12 bits are needed for the offset.
     * **Concern** | The memory requirement for page tables can be significant,
       e.g., 4MB per process for 1 million mappings.
     * **Concern** | Access time to the page table is a challenge, requiring
       efficient management of the page table base register (PTBR).
       
 5.  Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) Concept
     * **Fact** | The TLB caches page translations to improve memory access
       efficiency.
     * **Fact** | The virtual address space starts at 100, which corresponds to the
       fourth offset within VPN 6.
     * **Fact** | An 8-bit virtual address space with 16-byte pages requires 4 bits
       for page representation, allowing for 16 pages.
       
 6.  Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) Efficiency
     * **Fact** | Spatial locality and temporal locality are key concepts in caching
       that enhance efficiency.

       fixed-size chunks in both.
     * **Decision** | Increasing the page size can reduce the number of mappings and
       thus the size of the page table.
       
 12. Memory Management Techniques
     * **Decision** | Combining segmentation and paging could potentially create a
       more efficient memory management system.
     * **Concern** | Increasing page size reduces the number of pages but may lead
       to less efficient memory usage due to internal fragmentation.

       100 processes.
       
 14. Optimization of Page Table Structure
     * **Concern** | The challenge of storing all mappings in a single set of blocks
       is raised.
     * **Fact** | Modern operating systems may use seven to eight level page tables,
       but a two-level page table will be discussed as an example.
       
 15. Multi-Level Page Tables Concept
     * **Fact** | For 16 pages in physical address space, 4 bits are needed for
       addressing.
     * **Fact** | The page table can take sizes like 16 MB or 10 MB, and
       partitioning can reduce space usage.
     * **Fact** | Most entries in a traditional page table are invalid, which can
       lead to inefficient space usage.
       
 16. Page Table Management and Efficiency
