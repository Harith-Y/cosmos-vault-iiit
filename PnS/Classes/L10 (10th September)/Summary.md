The meeting focused on the importance of performance in the science course,
particularly regarding multiple random variables, emphasizing the need for
increased student effort due to the course's growing complexity. Key discussions
included the concepts of joint probability mass functions, marginalization, and
the independence of random variables, illustrated through examples such as dice
rolls. The instructor highlighted the significance of understanding probability
measures and the relationship between joint and marginal distributions.
Additionally, the meeting covered the calculation of expected values for
independent random variables and the verification of independence using joint
probability mass functions. The session concluded with an action plan for
participants to practice calculating the average value of the product of random
variables based on die rolls.

**Next steps**
 * Participants are tasked to work through an example of calculating the average
   value of the product of X and Y based on rolling a die.

**AI Insights** 

The meeting demonstrated a mixed performance across key performance indicators.
While there was a moderate level of commitment from participants and a high
degree of engagement with feedback, the action plan lacked completeness, with no
specific tasks or deadlines outlined. Goal clarity varied significantly, with
some discussions providing clear insights into concepts like joint probability
and independence, while others failed to articulate specific measurable goals,
resulting in lower clarity scores. Overall, the meeting highlighted strengths in
participant engagement and understanding of certain concepts, but also revealed
areas needing improvement in action planning and goal articulation.
